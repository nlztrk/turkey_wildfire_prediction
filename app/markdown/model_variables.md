# Used Variables

The model attempts to predict future wildfire probabilities by utilizing historical stored earth measurement data and statistics derived from this data. In this prediction step, the following raw and derived variables are used.

---

#### Latitude
The angular distance of a place north or south of the earth's equator, or of the equator of a celestial object, expressed in degrees.
#### Longitude
The angular distance of a place east or west of the Greenwich meridian, or west of the standard meridian of a celestial object, expressed in degrees.
#### Month
The month of wildfire prediction period
#### Fire Report Count (Before)
Number of fire reports in the past for a specific latitude-longitude pair
#### Fire Count (Before)
The number of fires with a high probability of occurring in the past for a specific latitude-longitude pair
#### Fire Report (Last Year)
Number of fire reports in the last year for a specific latitude-longitude pair
#### Fire Count (Last Year)
The number of fires with a high probability of occurring in the last year for a specific latitude-longitude pair
#### Fire Report (Same Month of the Last Year)
Number of fire reports in the same month of the last year for a specific latitude-longitude pair
#### Fire Count (Same Month of the Last Year)
The number of fires with a high probability of occurring in the same month of the last year for a specific latitude-longitude pair
#### Minimum Temperature
Lowest temperature during the month.
#### Maximum Temperature
Highest temperature during the month.
#### Average Temperature
Average temperature during the month.
