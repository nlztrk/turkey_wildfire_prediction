## Changes & Updates

The additions and updates made ***since the first submission phase*** are summarized here.

### Additions
- **Hyper-parameter tuning** script has been added under notebooks folder.
- **An analysis notebook** that provides a basic overview of wildfire, temperature and the full training data has been added *(03. DataAnalysis)*. You can find the graphics about the distribution of the data and my interpretations about them in the notebook.
- Added **a data insights page** for ***Wildfire Dataset***, ***Temperature Dataset*** and ***Full Training Dataset*** to the app that includes similar analyses with the notebook. But these analyses can also be viewed by non-data people, and are interactive. The scale of the graphs can be adjusted and detailed with mouse actions.

### Updates
- Since there are more application pages now, the navigation menu has been divided into groups for easier use and its design has been changed.
- Unnecessary lines were eliminated by moving frequently used variables to a common python script.
- Updated feature importance plots in model details page.
